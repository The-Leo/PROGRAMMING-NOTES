# GCC COMPILATION
**GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** is a free and open-source compiler system developed by the GNU Project. It supports a wide range of programming languages, including C, C++, Ada, Fortran, Objective-C, and more. 
GCC compilation refers to the process of using the GCC compiler to translate source code written in these languages into executable machine code that can be executed on a specific target platform.

The GCC compilation process typically involves several steps:

1. **Preprocessing:** The source code goes through the preprocessor, which performs tasks such as including header files, expanding macros, and handling conditional compilation directives.

2. **Compilation:** The preprocessed code is then compiled into assembly code specific to the target architecture. This step involves lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and optimization. The output is typically in the form of assembly language instructions.

3. **Assembly:** The assembly code generated in the previous step is assembled into object code, which consists of binary instructions specific to the target platform. This step translates the human-readable assembly code into machine-readable instructions.

4. **Linking:** If the program consists of multiple source files or uses external libraries, the object code from the previous step is linked together with other object files and libraries to create the final executable file. The linker resolves symbols, performs address relocation, and generates the executable file in a suitable format for the target platform.


## GCC FLAGS BY ALX
GCC flags are command-line options used with the GCC compiler to modify its behavior during the compilation process. 
The specific set of flags used can vary depending on the project's requirements and coding standards.

1. **-Wall:** Enables additional warning messages. It instructs the compiler to display a wide range of warning messages, helping to catch potential issues in your code. It is generally a good practice to enable this flag to ensure code quality.

2. **-Werror:** Treats all warnings as errors. When this flag is enabled, any warning generated by the compiler will be treated as an error, causing the compilation to fail. This flag can help enforce strict adherence to coding standards and improve code robustness.

3. **-Wextra:** Enables supplementary warning messages. This flag enables additional warning checks beyond what is enabled by -Wall. It provides even more thorough code analysis and can help identify potential issues that -Wall might not catch.

4. **-pedantic:** Emits warnings for code that doesn't strictly adhere to the selected language standard. It ensures compliance with the chosen language standard and provides more strict warnings for non-standard code constructs or language extensions.

5. **-std=gnu89:** Specifies the C language standard to use during compilation. In this case, gnu89 refers to the GNU dialect of the C language based on the ANSI C89/C90 standard with some GNU extensions. It indicates that the code should be compiled using the GNU C compiler in the C89/C90 standard with additional GNU-specific features.
