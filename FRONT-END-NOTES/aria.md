# ARIA

**ARIA, or Accessible Rich Internet Applications**, is a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve the accessibility
of web content and applications for people with disabilities. 
It is a specification developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to provide additional semantics to web content,
making it more understandable by assistive technologies such as screen readers and braille displays.

ARIA is particularly important in modern web development because many web applications rely heavily on dynamic content and complex user
interface elements that may not be adequately described by standard HTML elements alone. 
By using ARIA attributes, developers can provide more meaningful information about the purpose, behavior, and structure 
of web components, improving their accessibility to a wider range of users.


## ARIA attributes can be categorized into three main groups:

**Roles:** ARIA roles define the type of UI element and its purpose. For example, role="button" indicates that an element functions as 
a button, while role="textbox" indicates a text input field.

**States and properties:** ARIA states and properties describe the current state or properties of an element. For example, 
aria-disabled="true" indicates that an element is disabled, while aria-expanded="false" indicates that a collapsible element is currently collapsed.

**Relationships:** ARIA attributes for relationships describe the relationship between elements, such as labeling one element 
with another or associating a control with its corresponding label. For example, aria-labelledby associates an element with 
the ID of another element that serves as its label.

By using ARIA attributes appropriately, developers can ensure that their web applications are more accessible to users with
disabilities, including those who rely on assistive technologies to navigate and interact with web content. 

However, it's important to note that ARIA should be used as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, native HTML semantics. 
Developers should strive to use native HTML elements and attributes whenever possible and only resort to ARIA when necessary 
to enhance accessibility. Additionally, developers need to understand the proper usage and limitations of ARIA to avoid 
creating accessibility barriers unintentionally.
